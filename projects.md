* The aim is to improve your programming skills, and make well-written and documented project, rather that a super-duper program to impress me. Do not be over ambitious: I prefer short program(s) that do things that are not too complicated and which are easy to understand.

* You can use whichever language is suited to your project (Python, R, Matlab, Javascript, ...). The only rule is that the code must be readable. 

* Work in binomes:  it is important to have someone else check that the documentation and code that you write is readable.

* You must put your project on github, in a depository which name starts with `PCBS-` followed by a label that gives an idea of what the project is about.

* An example of the kind of thing I am expecting from you is available at http://chrplr.github.com/PCBS-LexicalDecision 

* Send me a link to your github project as soon as possible: I want to be able to check your progress. Ideally, I should be able to clone your repository and execute your code without modifying anything. That means, for example, that you should avoid absolute pathnames. 

* The entry point to your report must be the `README.md` file from the master branch. I will only read the documents on your github repository linked from this file. (It is fine if README.md points to reports in html generated fro example by Rmarkdown for example). No pdfs, no Word documents! I will simply not read them. I recommend that you use the 'Pages' system of github (see https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages).


* The deadline is Jan 25, 16h (the end of the last class). I will be available at the ENS the 11th of Jan and 25th (I am abroad on the 18th). DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT to ask for help: Use slack/#général (no direct messages to me please: there are 40 of you).
