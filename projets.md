* the aim is to improve your programming skills, and make a clean, well written and document project,rather that a super-duper program to impress me.  Work in binome so have someone else check tht you wirte documentation and code that is readable.

* you must use github and the entry point to your report must be the README.md file (your report must be in markdown, not word, odt, etc.). I recommend that you use the 'Pages'  system of github (https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages). I will only read the documents on your github repository linked from the README.md file. (it is fine if your README.md points to reports generated by Rmd for example)

* Please send me your emails, and a link to your github project ASAP: I want to be able to check your progress.

* The deadline is Jan 25, 16h (the end of the last class). I will be available at the ENS the 4th, 11th of Jan and 25th (I am abroad on the 18th). DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT to ask for help. Use slack/#general if you do not come to the class (no direct messages to me please: there are 40 of you).
