<h1>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The aim is that you spend a few dozens hours programming a project
related to cognitive or neurocognitive sciences (experimental tasks,
simulations of models, data analyses, …), in order for you to learn new
things and improve your coding skills.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All documents (scripts, documentation, data files when not too large)
related to the project should be on a github.com repository. I should
be able to read the README.md file and understand what the project is
about, how to run it, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Readability of the code and adherence to good practices: Do not be
overambitious: I prefer a readable code that does a simple thing
rather than an unreadble code that does complicated things.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in binomes to read, check and criticize each other code
regularily</p></li>
<li><p>use the slack to ask questions</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Some ideas<a class="headerlink" href="#some-ideas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How much time does it take for information to cross the two
hemispheres? Write a simple detection experiment where a visual
target can appear in the left or right hemifield and the response can
be given with the left or right hand. Can you detect a difference
between the reaction times when the hand and the target are on the
same side or not? (See Poffenberger, A. T. (1912). Reaction Time to
Retinal Stimulation. (R. S. Woodworth, Ed.). New York: The Science
Press and Marzi, Carlo A., P. Bisiacchi, and R. Nicoletti. 1991. “Is
Interhemispheric Transfer of Visuomotor Information Asymmetric?
Evidence from a Meta-Analysis.” Neuropsychologia 29 (12): 1163–1177.)</p></li>
<li><p>The vertical midline splits the visual fields into two halves that
are represented in contralateral hemispheres. While space is
retinotopically encoded across most visual areas within each
hemisphere, the vertical division between hemifields necessarily
disrupts this topological organization. What are the functional
consequences of the vertical split. P. Mamassian investigated how
crossing the vertical midline impairs motion sensitivity (Mamassian,
P. (2010). Locating the functional vertical midline with a motion
probe [Abstract]. Journal of Vision, 10(7):1379, 1379a,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/10/7/1379">http://www.journalofvision.org/content/10/7/1379</a>,
doi:10.1167/10.7.1379.). Implement his experiment in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when a visual object that is physically present but that
disappears temporarily from consciousness really disappears? Create a
motion-induced blindness display, have the subject press and hold a
button when one of the targets disappears from consciousness, and
then, after a few seconds, have it really disappear from the screen.
What do you see? Does the target disappear ‘quietly’, or does
something else happen? What does this tell you about visual
consciousness? See Mitroff &amp; Scholl (2005), Forming and updating
object representations without awareness: evidence from
motion-induced blindness. (project suggested by Mark Wexler)</p></li>
<li><p>When asked to generate random sequences of digits, people usually
perform poorly (i.e., non-random; Wagenaar, 1972). A paradigm to
measure deviations from randomness is the Random Number Generation
(RNG; e.g., Ginsburg &amp; Karpiuk, 1994) task. In this task,
participants are asked to produce sequences of digits (e.g., 1–10) in
a random fashion. Program the task (It is not trivial as you must use
automatic speech recognition to recognize the digits), and
investigate the various vatiables that have been proposed to account
for subjects’ behavior. See Peters et al. (2007). The random number
generation task: Psychometric properties and normative data of an
executive function task in a mixed sample. <em>Journal of the
International Neuropsychological Society</em> (Project suggested by
Jerome Sackur)</p></li>
<li><p>Artificial Neural networks. You can program a simulation from scratch
of one of those simple neural networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hopfield network</p></li>
<li><p>Kohonen network</p></li>
<li><p>a simple auto-encoder with one middle layer</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Create a pseudoword generator, that is a program that generates
strings of characters that look like possible words but do not exist
in the lexicon of a given language. There are many strategies to
generate pseudowords (e.g., random, following a probabilistic model,
using neural networks…). You can implement one or several of them.
The language can be French or English, or your generator could work
with any language for which you have a corpus.</p></li>
<li><p>Build an automatic classifier that tries to identify the language
(e.g. English vs French) of a text from letter statistics; Test it on
words, sentences, full documents. You must use cross validation (the
test and training sets must be different). Plot the identifciation
performance as a function of the lenght of the text (in characters).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/maarten-van-casteren/mixandmatch/">Mix and
Match</a>
are tools to support experimental research. Mix will allow
experimental stimuli to be pseudo-randomised, according to
constraints supplied by the user in a simple script. Match can match
the conditions of factorial experiments. Write similar tools in
Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know the <em>Countdown game</em> (“Le compte est bon” en français)?
An interesting question is how do humans solve it. About this, read
Daniel Defays (2015) Numbo: A study in cognition and recognition. In
Douglas Hofstadter (editor), <em>Fluid concepts and creative analogies:
computer models of the fundamental mechanisms of thought</em>). Implement
one or several algorithms to solve this type of puzzles (after trying
to invent your own algorithm(s), you can learn about the ones
proposed by Jean-Marc Alliot (2015). “The (Final) Countdown.”
ArXiv:1502.05450 [Cs], February. http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05450.)</p></li>
