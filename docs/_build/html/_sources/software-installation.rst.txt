Software Installation
=====================

This document provides instructions to install the required software on your computer:


.. contents::


Warnings
--------
-  You will need to download about 1GB of software from the Internet.
   Therefore, make sure to have a decent connection.
-  Make sure that you have at least 5GB of free space on your hard drive
   to unpack the various software.
-  You might need to have administrator rights to install some of the
   softwares. If you are using a computer from an Institution, this is
   not always the case. Check with your IT team.
-  If you are using Windows 10, make sure your user name doesn’t include
   spaces or characters that don’t belong to the English alphabet
   (accents, ideograms,…). If you do, better create a new user with a
   simple identifier.


Anaconda Python3
----------------

Among various python distributions, we recommend the `Anaconda
distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`__ because it comes
with most of the packages needed for the lectures.

1. Go to the `Anaconda Python distribution
   page <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`__. Select your OS —
   Windows, MacOS or Linux — and download the *Python 3.7* 64 bits
   installer.
2. Go to your download folder and execute the Anaconda3 installer.
3. In the Anaconda Setup Wizard, beware, pay attention to the following
   options option:

   -  verify that you Install for ``Just Me (recommended)``, then click
      on ``Next``
   -  Accept the default Destination folder and click on ``Next``
   -  IMPORTANT: Check the boxes “Add Anaconda to my PATH” and “Register
      Anaconda as my default Python” and click on ``Install``
   -  upon completion, click on ‘Next’, then ``Finish``


Expyriment
----------

We will need the Python library `Expyriment <http://www.expyriment.org/>`__

1. Open a Terminal:

-  Under Linux, launch ``Terminal`` from your applications menu or use
   ``Ctrl-Alt-T``.
-  under MacOS: type ``terminal`` in the Spotlight search field.
   Alternatively, you can open a ``Finder`` window and select the
   ``Application`` folder, then the ``Utilities`` folder, then
   double-click on the ``Terminal`` icon..
-  Under Windows, launch ``Anaconda Prompt``

2. Type:

::

       pip install expyriment

3. Test that the installation went fine. In the terminal, type:

::

      ipython

This should display something like:

::

   Python 3.7.4 (default, Aug  9 2019, 18:51:30) 
   Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
   IPython 7.8.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

It means that you are interacting with the ipython programme. Now type:

::

      import expyriment

If all went well, you should see a message such as:

::

   pygame 1.9.6
   Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
   Expyriment 0.9.0 (Python 3.7.4) 

Finally, press ‘Ctrl-D’ to exit ipython, and type ``exit`` to close the
terminal.


Git
---

Git is a version control tool for software development, an indispensable
tool for reproducible science.

*  **Ubuntu Linux** : Just execute ``sudo apt install git`` in a
   terminal.
*  **MacOS**: Download the ``Git for Mac`` installer from
   https://git-scm.com/download/mac and execute it. Accept all the
   defaults.
*  **Windows**: Download ``Git for windows`` from
   https://git-scm.com/download/win and execute it. Accept all the
   defaults.

   IMPORTANT (Windows only): During Git’s installation, you will be
   asked a few questions, it is *crucial* that:

      - you tick the box "Use Git and optional unix tools from the command line prompt". 
      - when proposed to select a text editor, you choose `nano` (instead of the default, `vim`) 

   For other options/questions the defaults are fine.

   (Note: if you are hesitant, check the graphical instructions provided
   at https://hackernoon.com/install-git-on-windows-9acf2a1944f0)



Whatever your operating system, MacOSX, Linux or Windows, you now need
to configure git. Open a Terminal (*Git Bash* under Windows) and type::


    git config --global user.name "your_first_and_last_names_here" 
    git config --global user.email your_email_here 
    git config --global core.editor nano


A Text Editor
-------------

A text editor is a program that allows you to edit pure text files such
as python scripts, mardown documents, …

Unless you already use a text editor that you are happy with, we
recommend that you download and install *Sublime Text* from
https://www.sublimetext.com/. Follow the instructions specific for your
Operating System.

If you prefer opensource software, try `Atom <http://atom.io>`__, but be
aware that it is slower and more buggy than sublime text.

Finally, if you like small and simple things, you can instead use the
lightweight editor `micro <https://micro-editor.github.io/>`__


The R statistical software
--------------------------

R is a programming language specialized for data analyses.

-  **Windows** Download and install the latest version of R from
   https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
-  **MacOS**: Download and install the latest version of R from
   https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/
-  **Linux**: Find the version relevant for your distribution at
   https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ and follow the instructions in
   the ``README.html`` file.


Rstudio Desktop
---------------

Rstudio is an Integrated Developpement Environment for R which greatly
simplifies the use of \__RMarkdown_. You can download and install the
latest version of \__RStudio Desktop\_ from
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Make sure to select
the correct Operating System!
