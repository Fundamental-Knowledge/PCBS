Know how to open a Terminal
---------------------------

-  **Linux**: Launch ``Terminal`` from your application menu or use
   \`Ctrl-Alt-T*\* (gnome, xfce), or Win+Enter (i3)).

-  **MacOS**: Type ``terminal`` in the Spotlight search field.
   Alternatively, you can open a ``Finder`` window and select the
   ``Application`` folder, then the ``Utilities`` folder, then
   double-click on the ``Terminal`` icon..

-  **Windows**: Start ``Git Bash`` (This assumes that you have installed
   ``Git for windows`` as described in `Instructions for software
   installation <#instructions-for-software-installation>`__)

1. Click the Windows or Start icon.
2. In the Programs list, open the Git folder.
3. Click the option for Git Bash.

Inside a terminal, you interact with a program that expects you to type
commands. This program is called a *shell*. You need to know the
following commands in order to navigate the filesystem.

-  *ls*: list the content of the current working directory
-  *pwd*: path of current working directory
-  *cd*: change directory

This will be sufficient for this lecture, but if you want to learn more
about how to use the Terminal/Shell, check out the section `Resources to
learn the command shell <#resources-to-learn-the-command-shell>`__.

Downloading the course materials
--------------------------------

Once you have installed Git on your computer, you can download the
course materials: Open a terminal and type:

::

       git clone https://github.com/chrplr/PCBS.git

This should download the course materials in a folder named ‘PCBS’
(Remark: if a folder with that name already exists, git will stop and
not download the content of the website. In that case, delete or move
the existing PCBS folder before running the ``git clone`` command above)

I do often update the materials. To synchronize your local copy with the
latest version, you just need to open a terminal and type:

::

      cd PCBS
      git pull

Remark: do not manually modify or create new files in the PCBS folder.
If you do so, git will notice it and might prevent an automatic upgrade
and ask us to ‘resolve conflicts’. If you get such a message, the
simplest course of action for beginner, is to delete the PCBS folder (or
move it if you wnat to keep a copy of your modifications) and reuse the
git clone command above to reload the full folder.

Basic programming concepts
--------------------------

If you are a complete beginner, to get acquainted with some basic
programming concepts (instructions, variables, tests (if…then…else) and
loops (while and for)), I recommend that you learn to play with Scratch
`Starting-from-scratch <01_Starting-from-Scratch/Starting-from-Scratch.md>`__

Basic skills
------------

Beyond knowing how to open a terminal (see above), there are few skills
that you need to acquire:

how to download a Python script from the Internet and execute it from a command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try the following:

1. Download the script, e.g. `games/matches.py <games/matches.py>`__.
   Make sure you know in which directory the file has been saved.
2. Open a terminal and use the ``cd``, ``pwd`` , and ``ls`` commands to
   navigate to the directory containing the file that you have just
   downloaded; Then, type:

::

         python matches.py

how to start `ipython <http://ipython.org>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try it:

-  Open a Terminal, type ``ipython`` and press “Return”,
-  After the prompt ``In [1]:``, type ``2**64`` and ‘Return’
-  Then, type the following lines in the ipython shell:

::

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        t = np.linspace(0, 30, num=3001)
        plt.plot(t, np.sin(t))

If a Window open with a graphical representation of the sine function,
Congratulations! (you can press ‘q’ in the Window to close it)

-  Type ``quit()`` to quit ipython, then ``exit`` to quit the shell and
   close the terminal.

create and/or modify scripts with a text editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a text editor like
`micro <https://micro-editor.github.io/>`__, `Sublime
Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`__ or `Atom <http://atom.io>`__, or
an Integrated Development Environment like Spyder or PyCharm.

To work you will basically need two windows side by side: one with a
text editor displaying the code, and one with ipython to test it (add
maybe a browser when you need to google for help about Python).

See `running python <running-python.md>`__

Use Git to keep your project clean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Git <https://www.gitbook.com/>`__ is a software that allow you to keep
track of the modifications of your files, to test alternatives, to share
the work.

Git is a quite complex tool, but for this lecture, you will only need to
know very few commands (`git clone, git pull, git init, git add, git
status, git commit and git push``)

Appendix <#resources-to-learn-git>`__
